# Traxpense (Java, MySQL)

## Knowledge Gained
Applying my Java Swing knowledge from my intro Java course, I used JavaFX and Scenebuilder to build the app's GUIs. Instead of writing objects to a file to store all of their information, I decided to learn some SQL and setup a server on my home computer to track a user's expenses. Using a primary key, I divided up tables to ensure data from one user cannot be mistaken for another. I learned a lot about data integrity, GUIs, and managing many classes.

## Traxpense's Objective
Have you ever wanted to track your financial profits and losses? As I continue to grow older, I opt for more financial security and want to ensure that I know how I spend my money. **\[To be continued]**

## Future Updates and Ideas
* Customizable profit and loss categories, as currently they are tailored to how I want to manage my money
* Profiles to see how others are doing and a message board for users to post tips on how they use and save their money
* Make the show password work on the login screen
* Be able to change username and other account information
* Have a more detailed view on how a user spends their money instead of just having it broken down by month
